            <h2>Buy properties with bitcoin</h2>
            
			<br>

A property must be registered in a currency linked to a central bank.
Once the buyer and seller are willing to make the transaction using cryptocurrencies, it is necessary that the acquisition is registered in euros -in the European Union the exchange of bitcoins to euros is not subject to VAT-, that is, "the cryptocurrency must be translated into the currency of the country in which we want to buy the apartment and formalize all the formalities with the Tax Agency". The problem with bitcoins in these cases is that, "as they are decentralized, the apartment cannot be deeded in any way in cryptocurrencies, but always in currencies linked to a central bank".
<br><br>
In addition, due to its instability, it is convenient to set an exact moment in which to make the translation to euros before a notary, -in the deed of the house the price will always appear in that currency-. Bermúdez clarifies that "it is a normal and ordinary purchase and sale procedure before a notary, with the only difference being that, at the agreed time, the value of the cryptocurrency is translated into euros in order to be able to legally deed the property".
<br><br>
<h2>Proving its origin</h2>
<br>
Faced with these transactions, it might be necessary for the buyer to clarify the origin of the amount paid in cryptocurrencies. For his part, the seller could assume the risk that the value of the bitcoin could go down from the moment of the transaction. The uncertainty and lack of knowledge of this market means that, in general, "sellers who accept this type of coins are large investors in the field of cryptocurrencies, so they almost always come out ahead", concludes Bermúdez.
<br><br>
In this regard, Ferran Font, director of research at pisos.com, adds that "it has to be someone who understands what bitcoin is and the fluctuations it can undergo, understands that it is an investment that at some point may be more or less profitable and that it is at the expense of the ups and downs that these types of currencies have". Therefore, in general, "the one who may be more interested in buying an apartment with bitcoin is usually an investor in cryptocurrencies who wants to convert them into a physical good such as a home".
<br><br>
"there are some bitcoin investors who have made large profits and are already reinvesting them in the purchase of luxury housing". Crisenti highlights that this type of operations are a "reality and, probably, are here to stay". However, "purchases with bitcoins sometimes end up being stopped due to money laundering prevention. It is a type of currency that is being associated with illegal practices, so proving that the origin of the money is licit in a well-documented way is fundamental and sometimes not possible."
<br><br>
"Notaries also have to evolve towards virtual notaries with blockchain technology, which allows you to notarize the transaction you have made through an internet platform that allows transparency and that these operations can be raised to public. This, in turn, must be accepted by the registry. Many things are involved that today we have standardized because they are physical procedures, but in the digital environment or everyone is connected or else it does not work well. Little by little things are changing in that sense",
